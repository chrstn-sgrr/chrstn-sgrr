## About Me

*   💻 Currently diving deep into learning languages and creating projects to build fundamentals.
*   📚 Always learning something new! Right now, I'm developing an Hypertropy Tracker App and learning a bit of Java from class.
*   🧠 My philosophy as a developer: Just keep learning and build stuff. Specifically build stuff that I myself would like to use.
*   🏋️‍♂️ Off the keyboard, you'll find me in the gym or playing osu!
